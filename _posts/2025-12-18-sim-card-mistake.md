title: I assumed my SIM card would work overseas
where: First day landing in Japan
why: We overestimate roaming coverage and underestimate local SIM friction.
fix: Always check roaming compatibility or pre-book an eSIM before flying.
takeaway: Assume nothing works the moment you land.

No data. No maps. No WhatsApp.

The mistake wasn’t technical — it was **assumptive**. I assumed modern phones “just work” everywhere.
